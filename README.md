# SplatAway
SplatAway is a single player sci-fi FPS game developed using Unity game engine (C#). A maze like level layout design was implemented to challenge players when finding their escape. The AI in the game is designed to have offensive/defensive behavior meaning enemies will approach you to fire and fall back to decrease the chances of dying. Particles on enemies and objects were added to enhance the overall feel and look of the game.
## Objective
An overrun spaceship is taken over by hostile creatures and the lone survivor (player) must find an escape while staying alive.
